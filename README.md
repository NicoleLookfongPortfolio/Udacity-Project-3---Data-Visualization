GoBike Data Analysis

Project Details

This project analyzes the GoBike trip dataset to explore trends, user behavior, and usage patterns within the Bay Area. The project is divided into two phases: Exploratory Analysis and Explanatory Analysis. The exploratory phase involves understanding the dataset and extracting preliminary insights, while the explanatory phase presents findings that tell a story and answer specific questions through polished visualizations.

The key objective is to identify metrics that define user habits and investigate differences between user types, such as "Subscriber" and "Customer," while highlighting significant insights through visual storytelling.

Dataset

The GoBike dataset contains information about individual bike trips, including trip duration, start and end times, station locations, and user demographics (such as age, gender, and user type). The dataset provides an opportunity to explore bike-sharing habits in the Bay Area and uncover insights into user behavior.

Summary of Findings

The exploratory analysis reveals that most users are subscribers, indicating a preference for the subscription model, especially among frequent users. Customers, on the other hand, tend to have longer rides, potentially for recreational purposes.

The explanatory analysis addresses key questions about user behavior, such as how usage varies by day of the week, how ride duration differs across age groups and user types, and which user groups are most active. Key visualizations demonstrate that subscribers have consistent activity throughout the week, likely for commuting, while customers have increased activity during weekends.

Key Insights for Presentation

The visualizations from the explanatory analysis include:

Ride Distribution by User Type and Gender: A bar chart showing that subscribers make up a significant majority of users for both male and female riders, suggesting that the service is primarily used by regular commuters.

Average Trip Duration by Age Group and User Type: A facet plot illustrating that customers aged 20-25 tend to have the longest ride durations, around 25 minutes on average, compared to subscribers who have consistent trip durations across all age groups.

Ride Activity by Day of the Week: A bar chart demonstrating higher usage during weekdays for subscribers, indicating commuting usage, while customers have a stronger presence during weekends, suggesting leisure activity.

The visualizations were chosen to effectively convey these patterns, with clear axis labels, annotations, and logical sequencing to support the insights derived from the dataset.
